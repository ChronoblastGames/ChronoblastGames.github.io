      Hi there; my name's Matt and I am an Independent Game Developer. I've been making games for over two and half years now and it is something that I am really passionate about.<br><br>
        Throughout the last two years I've worked on more than a handful of projects, spanning different slew of genres and platforms. I also have experience in both working in a team and also working solo on projects.
        <br> <br> I've got experience in both Game Design and Game Programming. I mostly work in Unity 5, as it is the engine I am most confortable with.
        <br> <br> Listed below are some of the many games I've worked on over the last few years.

                Cubic Conundrum is the project I'm most proud of to date. <br> <br> I worked on Cubic Conundrum all by myself during the summer of 2016; this was the first time I worked on a larger scale project and also one in which I had to fill all the roles during development. <br><br> The goal I had in mind while creating Cubic Conundrum was that I wanted to make a game that anyone could pick up and play and that also appealed to a large audience. <br> <br> I showed off the prototype at two different gaming events: The Montreal International Games Summit 2016 and The Montreal Independent Games Festival 2016. <br><br> I got a large amount of positive feedback, however I decided to suspend developement until a later date to when I had gathered more knowledge and experience in the industry. <br> <br> You can play it in your browser by following the button below.

                XTREME WAVE POLO 3000 is the game I made for the 2017 Global Game Jam. The theme of the Jam was: Waves. <br> <br> XTREME WAVE POLO 3000 has players clash against one another in hybrid form of wave polo in which players must use the waves they create to propel the ball into their opponents goal! <br><br> I worked on this together with a couple of friends from school and I am pretty happy on how it turned out. <br><br> It was my first time working on something multiplayer and I learned alot on how to setup player lobbies and balance mechanics with multiple players in mind.

            Innermind is a game I made during the Dawson 2016 GameJam. <br><br> Innermind has players explore a abstract world by traveling through portals to find the exit. <br><br> With Innermind I wanted to make something abstract and visual but also simple; so I ultimately decided on making a first person puzzle game that utilized portals as it's main mechanic as it was something that was easily possible in the limited time frame.

            Cube Shuffle is the game I made during my first Game Jam. <br><br> The rules of the jam we're simple: You had to make a game that contained fewer than 5 assets and mechanics. <br><br> I decided to use this opportunity to make my first mobile game; so I stuck with an extremely simple design that allowed me to complete it realitively quickly. <br> <br> You play it in browser by following the link below!
